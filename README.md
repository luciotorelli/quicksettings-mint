# Quick Settings Panel for Linux Mint

## Project Overview
Quick Settings Panel for Linux Mint that provides users with quick access to essential system settings. While Linux mint is my favourite Linux flavor, I have been missing a quick settings panel.

## User Stories
The following user stories describe what users should be able to do with the Quick Settings Panel:

- **Wi-Fi Management**: Users should be able to turn Wi-Fi on and off with a single click and access Wi-Fi settings for more advanced options.

- **Bluetooth Management**: Users should be able to turn Bluetooth on and off easily and access Bluetooth settings to manage connected devices.

- **Monitor Controls**: Users should be able to change the contrast and brightness of connected monitors using `ddcutil`.

- **Laptop Screen Brightness**: Users should be able to adjust the brightness of their laptop monitor directly from the panel.

- **Volume Control**: Users should be able to change the system volume using a simple slider.

- **Battery Status**: Users should be able to check the current battery level of their laptop, making it easy to see how much power remains.

- **Night Light Control**: Users should be able to turn the night light on or off, reducing blue light and making the screen easier on the eyes during nighttime use.

- **Shutdown Button**: Users should have a button that allows them to shut down the system directly from the Quick Settings Panel, providing a quick and easy way to power off their computer.
